			<h2 id="tribute-info">A short biography of Dr. Adler GP in London</h2>
			<div id="biography">
				<p>Dr. Shlomo Adler, a well known and devoted general practitioner who lived in Golders Green, NW London. Born 29 August 1923 to his father Dr. Abraham and mother Trude Adler, in Leipzig, Germany. Moved over with his parents to the UK in 1937 at his young age of 14. Passed away 20 December 2010 at the age of 87.
				</p>
				<p>He treated tens of thousands of patients over the years including Gedolei Yisroel and was renowned for the exemplary care with which he treated every human being, often seeing patients without receiving compensation and providing emotional in additional to medical care when he thought it was warranted. In certain difficult cases, Dr. Adler would concoct his own remedies which inexplicably brought about cures.
				</p>
				<p>The doctor was born in Leipzig, Germany in 1923, was the son of a doctor who treated the Chofetz Chaim, among others. After the untimely death of his father, Dr. Adler supported his entire family and his mother worked with him in his medical practice. Dr. Adler and his wife had three sons, all of whom were encouraged to somehow be involved in medicine so that they too could devote their lives to helping others.
				</p>
				<p>Dr. Adler never believed in wasting time and if he wasnâ€™t helping someone or practicing medicine, he could be found with a sefer in his hands.
				</p>
				<p>He was 87 at the time of his passing, and was still seeing patients two weeks earlier, despite having difficulty walking after suffering a fall approximately eighteen months before his passing.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="quotes">
				<p>His entire life was dedicated to helping people. He would often tell us <em>"we are not here for ourselves, we are here to help other people"</em>.

				<p>It is said that Rabbi Yaakov Leizer zt"l - late Pshevorsker Rebbe of Antwerp (Reb Yankele) gave Dr. Adler the name <em>"The Malach Refoel"</em>
